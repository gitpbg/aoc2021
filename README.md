# gitpbg's attempt at the 2021 Advent Of Code in Rust
Goal is to finish the competition in the time that I have i.e. functionality over code beauty aka ugly code :-)

* Day 1 - easy - learned itertools is awesome
* Day 2 - easy
* Day 3 - some struggle, but starting to like functional programming
* Day 4 - almost gave up on functional programming, but got a working solution.  Had to implement terminal color output to visualize the bingo boards.  Something that I have wanted to do for a long time but the opportunity never presented it self.  Now the genie is out of the bottle :-)
* Day 5 - Done, was relatively easy, parsing was a bit problematic.  Also got a solution and then refactored the code adding in structs for lines and points and a seafloor map just to make the code more readable.
* Day 6 - Did it the naive way first (commented code), then realized how exponentially horrible this problem was....  Couldn't figure out, but saw someones google sheets solution and a light bulb went off in my head.  Implemented it in Rust.  Feeling really silly about not being able to think like this in the first place :-)
* Day 7 - Did this one mathematically/analytically.  Noted that for the first part you need a median i.e. most frequently occuring value.  For the 2nd part it becomes mean. But mean is tricky and can be fractional so we use the floor and ceil of the computed mean.  And then take the min of both results.  Had to google sum of series formula.
* Day 8 - Very tricky - could have used sets but instead used iterators and filters to figure out the segments.  Built the numbers from the segments to decode the counter digits.
* Day 9 - Was easy but had work so fell behind.  Completed on the 9th but submitting today
* Day 10 - Relatively easy, stack to track matches and calculate scores.
* Day 11 - Took too long mainly because I decided to take a break over the weekend
* Day 12 - Started on 12/13
