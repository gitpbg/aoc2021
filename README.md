# gitpbg's attempt at the 2021 Advent Of Code in Rust
Goal is to finish the competition in the time that I have i.e. functionality over code beauty aka ugly code :-)

* Day 1 - easy - learned itertools is awesome
* Day 2 - easy
* Day 3 - some struggle, but starting to like functional programming
* Day 4 - almost gave up on functional programming, but got a working solution.  Had to implement terminal color output to visualize the bingo boards.  Something that I have wanted to do for a long time but the opportunity never presented it self.  Now the genie is out of the bottle :-)
* Day 5 - TBD
